# ✅ Vercel Deployment Checklist & Fixes

**Status:** 🟢 READY TO DEPLOY  
**Date:** October 22, 2025

---

## 🔍 Issues Found & Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Conflicting Build Commands in vercel.json
**Problem:** Custom `buildCommand` and `outputDirectory` can conflict with Vite auto-detection

**Fixed:** Removed custom build settings, let Vercel auto-detect Vite

**Before:**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [...]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

---

### ✅ Issue 2: Wrong Base Path in vite.config.js
**Problem:** `base: "./"` causes routing issues on Vercel

**Fixed:** Changed to `base: "/"`

**Before:**
```javascript
base: "./",  // ❌ Breaks Vercel routing
```

**After:**
```javascript
base: "/",   // ✅ Works on Vercel
```

---

### ✅ Issue 3: Duplicate Tailwind CSS Link
**Problem:** `index.html` had duplicate link tags

**Fixed:** Removed duplicate and added leading slash

**Before:**
```html
<link href="tailwind.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="tailwind.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

**After:**
```html
<link href="/tailwind.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

---

### ✅ Issue 4: .vercelignore Was Excluding Source Files
**Problem:** `src/` and `public/` folders were excluded

**Fixed:** Removed those lines from `.vercelignore`

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: Large Images

Your deployment has **HUGE images** that will slow down uploads:

```
investor.jpeg  → 8.4 MB ❌ TOO LARGE
main.jpeg      → 5.6 MB ❌ TOO LARGE
add y startups.jpeg → 665 KB ⚠️ Large
become a partner.jpeg → 435 KB ⚠️ Large
```

**Recommendation:** Optimize these before deploying (optional for first deployment)

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option A: Automatic GitHub Deployment (RECOMMENDED)

   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Vercel will automatically:**
   - Detect it's a Vite project
   - Run `npm install`
   - Run `npm run build`
   - Deploy from `dist/` folder

---

### Option B: Vercel CLI Deployment

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. **Deploy:**
```bash
# From project root
cd S:\CS\AGS-Eco
vercel

# For production
vercel --prod
```

3. **Follow prompts:**
   - Set up project name
   - Choose settings (or use defaults)
   - Deployment will start

## 🔧 Vercel Dashboard Settings

Once deployed, configure these in Vercel Dashboard:

### Build & Development Settings:
- **Framework Preset:** Vite (auto-detected)
- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (auto)
- **Output Directory:** `dist` (auto)
- **Install Command:** `npm install` (auto)

### Environment Variables:
Add these in Settings → Environment Variables:

```env
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
```

### Domain Settings:
- Your project will get a URL like: `ags-network.vercel.app`
- You can add custom domain later
